# Discussion with trans men:

---

## :space_invader: I'm a programmer on a team of people making an app about cervical screening (for anyone with a cervix). If you have time, could you answer some questions, please?

Hi! As I mentioned in the title, we're making an app to encourage people to go for cervical screening. The actual charity involved has a website which specifically mentions women most of the time, but has a couple of mentions of "women and trans men" which, in context, sounds like an afterthought (plus, there's no mention of non-binary people or anyone else).

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to "people with a cervix" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

So some opinions would be great - how does "people with a cervix" sound? Are there any pet hates you have, or things that make you feel like you aren't welcome? Any other thoughts?

Thanks. :)

:electric_plug: Personally, I would prefer if the app was in second person. As in “if you have a cervix, then...” or “often, the/your cervix.” I can’t imagine you would need to use gendered language in the app.

Otherwise, “people with a cervix” is reasonable. “Women and trans men” isn’t too unreasonable, but I think the former is preferable due to not all women having cervixes (people can have trachelectomies and women can be trans) and not all trans men having cervixes.

:pencil2: to :electric_plug: Plus the second way you phrased it excludes AFAB nb people. Listing identities would only make it more complicated - "people with cervixes" &/or 2nd person are both better solutions.

:space_invader: to :pencil2: That was exactly how I felt when I was looking through the charity's site (it's already established; we're just programmers who joined the project). Thank you!

:space_invader: to :electric_plug: Okay, I think I get what you mean, but please let me know if I've misunderstood. Basically I mean that the general description of what the app does and why the screening is necessary would be in the third person, but the vast majority would be in the second person because the app's function is basically to reassure people and make them feel like they aren't alone as they're guided through the steps of booking appointments etc.

And I agree that gendered language isn't necessary - I just hope that everyone else on the team does!

And yes, I totally agree. Not all women, trans men, non-binary people or literally any other group have a cervix, so "people with a cervix" was what I was leaning towards.

Thanks so much for your input!
