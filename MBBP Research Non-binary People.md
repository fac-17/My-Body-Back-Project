## :space_invader: Making an app about cervical screening - want AFAB non-binary people to feel included - thoughts?

Hi! I'm a programmer on a team that's making an app to encourage people to go for cervical screening. The actual charity involved has a website which specifically mentions women most of the time, but has a couple of mentions of "women and trans men" which, in context, sounds like an afterthought (plus, there's no mention of non-binary people or anyone else).

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to "people with a cervix" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

So some opinions would be great - how does "people with a cervix" sound? Are there any pet hates you have, or things that make you feel like you aren't welcome? Any other thoughts?

Thanks. :)

:full_moon: I’m personally fine with “people with a cervix”. And yeah, I’d feel pretty unwelcome and even more uncomfortable with my anatomy if an app addressed me as a woman or used female language the whole time while tossing out “and trans men” as an afterthought.

My pet hates:

“female-bodied”

“biologically female”

:space_invader: to :full_moon: Thanks for taking the time to reply. :) What you're saying makes total sense. The app is aimed at people who don't feel comfortable getting smear tests through the standard channels, so the last thing we need is for people to feel even more apprehensive or alienated.

:musical_note: to :space_invader: I agree with what everyone else here is saying--but also I really want to thank you for the work you're doing! This is (unfortunately) a topic that's personally relevant and I am very happy to hear that you/your team are trying to be as inclusive as possible for something that's already an uncomfortable topic

:space_invader: to :musical_note: No worries at all - it's the bare minimum! It's important to have this test done (between certain ages), so we can't have people being excluded based on gender. Hopefully we succeed in making everyone who needs the test feel welcome. :)

:wolf: to :full_moon: I wouldn't use female-bodied. Assigned female at birth (afab) or people with a cervix is probably best.

---

:space_invader: to :wolf: Fair enough - we wouldn't use the first two anyway, since cervixes can be removed and we're specifically addressing people with cervixes.

---

:sparkles: "People with a cervix" is ideal to me--it avoids unnecessary gendering and references the entire population you're targeting. If you want, you could also add something like "people with cervixes, which includes some trans men and nonbinary people, [insert message here]," though if you decide to include that, I'd only do it once or twice (because it can get really repetitive).

Phrases I dislike: Born a woman/born female Biologically female

Thank you for striving to be inclusive!

:space_invader: to :sparkles: Thanks, that's definitely do-able! :)

:ok_hand: yeah, it sounds fine. it kind of helps with making it sound more like an important health issue than an embarrassing genitals issue, too. "if you have a cervix, you need to check it!" so you are thinking about, like, taking good care of your cervix.

btw, "people with a cervix" sounds kind of weird when you use it too much in a row. switch it up with "everyone" and "folks", "owns a cervix" and "has a cervix", etc

sometimes it's still OK to just say women when you are talking about general issues, political things or statistics. like calling reproductive rights a women's rights issue, and women's colleges that also accept trans people that aren't women. in this usage "women" is just a catchy short-hand for a huge varied population anyways, so the actual members are clarified later in the description.

---

:space_invader: to :ok_hand: Awesome, thanks for responding! I appreciate it.

---

:surfer: Totally agree with this comment. Switching up the terms makes it feel way more natural and more like you know what you are talking about. People will feel more comfortable if they think you are comfortable!

---

:space_invader: to :surfer: Good point!

---

:ok_hand: oh, by the way, don't use AFAB as a concrete replacement for female-bodied. it's more a social term and doesn't correlate well with biology. (e.g. a baby with a vagina and functioning testes might be AFAB but develop phenotypically male). phenotype is a handy term too. or typically-female body. honestly, if you just alternate the terminology you're using a lot, it should become clear who you are talking about without being super hurtful. like a venn diagram of adjectives

:space_invader: to :ok_hand: Thanks for the info. I think in the sections where we clarify exactly what the app is for, the language will be more specific, but in most places we can just use "people."
