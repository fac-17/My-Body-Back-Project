:space_invader: ## Making an app about cervical screening - want AFAB non-binary people to feel included - thoughts?

Hi! I'm a programmer on a team that's making an app to encourage people to go for cervical screening. The actual charity involved has a website which specifically mentions women most of the time, but has a couple of mentions of "women and trans men" which, in context, sounds like an afterthought (plus, there's no mention of non-binary people or anyone else).

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to "people with a cervix" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

So some opinions would be great - how does "people with a cervix" sound? Are there any pet hates you have, or things that make you feel like you aren't welcome? Any other thoughts?

Thanks. :)

:full_moon: I’m personally fine with “people with a cervix”. And yeah, I’d feel pretty unwelcome and even more uncomfortable with my anatomy if an app addressed me as a woman or used female language the whole time while tossing out “and trans men” as an afterthought.

My pet hates:

“female-bodied”

“biologically female”

:space_invader: to :full_moon: Thanks for taking the time to reply. :) What you're saying makes total sense. The app is aimed at people who don't feel comfortable getting smear tests through the standard channels, so the last thing we need is for people to feel even more apprehensive or alienated.

:wolf: to :full_moon: I wouldn't use female-bodied. Assigned female at birth (afab) or people with a cervix is probably best.

:space_invader: to :wolf: Fair enough - we wouldn't use the first two anyway, since cervixes can be removed and we're specifically addressing people with cervixes.
