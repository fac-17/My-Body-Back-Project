# Discussion with trans people:

## :space_invader: Need opinions from non-cis people with cervixes - making an app that encourages people to go for cervical screening.

(For anyone with a cervix - although opinions from all are welcome.)

Hi! As I mentioned in the title, we're making an app to encourage people to go for cervical screening. The actual charity involved (my team is a separate group of programmers) has a website which specifically mentions women most of the time, but has a couple of mentions of "women and trans men" which, in context, sounds like an afterthought (plus, there's no mention of non-binary people or anyone else).

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to "people with a cervix" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

So some opinions would be great - how does "people with a cervix" sound? Are there any pet hates you have, or things that make you feel like you aren't welcome? Any other thoughts?

Thanks. :)

:shoe: Thanks for doing your due diligence and asking trans people. :) I'm nonbinary and have a cervix. I think if you can use "your cervix" "the cervix" etc. it would be preferable, but "people with a cervix" is also fine.

I'd also recommend staying clear of traditionally feminine colors (pink) or using the words "period" "feminine" or "female." Instead of "breast" use "chest", instead of "feminine products" use "menstrual products", instead of "period" use "menstrual cycle" or "monthly cycle."

Also keep in mind that even people who have cervixes may not menstruate so it's better to use "people with cervixes" than "people who menstruate" unless you're talking about menstruation. And instead of asking if someone is a mother it would be good to say "are you the parent of a child" or "have you ever given birth."

Good luck!

:space_invader: to :shoe: And thanks for replying! :)

Yep, I've already brought up the fact that we really shouldn't use pink, and the team agrees. Also, I know not to use gendered words for things like chest tissue and genitals, but when it comes to the more internal parts, like the cervix and ovaries, is that the same or different?

That's useful information, thank you! I appreciate it.

:stew: In this context, is there a reason why these services couldn't be advertised as "Open to all", and those without cervixes would naturally filter themselves out?
I say this only because of the general "Hmm..." feeling a lot of folks had when other companies started saying "menstruators" or "people who menstruate". It seems very clinical and objectifying to some, which could be a barrier to services.

In general, I've found myself (as an AFAB transman) more inclined to buy products or access services that visually implied accessibility versus those attempting uncommon forms of inclusive language. Having gender diversity featured visually always catches my eye, moreso than inclusive language which still uses cis female centered visuals.

If you're seeking that clinical angle, maybe "those who many be at risk of cervical **\_, \_\_**, and \_\_\_" and so on.

I hope your project is a success! Gender diverse folks desperately need healthcare access, and this sounds like a great tool to empower them to seek it. One note, be sure users know you don't endorse or represent, etc any doctors on your app (unless you do). We had an issue with an app 'recommending' our organization for services we don't provide, and it resulted in a drawn out legal conflict that really solved nothing. I'm sure you've already thought of that anyways~ Best of luck!!

:space_invader: to :stew: These questions are tricky to answer for me; I'll explain the context a bit better. A charity wants to make an app to help people who have experienced sexual assault to get smear tests. They've found that there's a certain resistance involved (the process can bring back trauma, and sometimes the medical professionals can be insensitive etc.). This is really unfortunate because statistically they're at a greater risk. (You probably know all this, but I feel it's necessary context just in case.) The app aims to guide them through the process and make them feel a bit more comfortable.

We're the programming team, not the medical professionals, but having had a look at their website it seems very necessary to revamp a lot of the phrasing (the front page only refers to women) and some of the design (the logo isn't pink, but the website greets us with a large banner of pink Venus symbols). As the programming team, we won't have control over everything, but we can at least push for more inclusive phrasing and design.

I definitely see what you're saying; we'll aim for wording that's less gendered but that doesn't reduce people to body parts.

And thank you - that's a great point from an alternate perspective.

I really appreciate the response! :)

:cloud: I like that a lot, and I agree with another commenter about not making the presentation all girly. Pink flowery stuff is a visual cue to me (as a trans dude) that that particular thing is not aimed at me and I tend to skip it over.

---

:space_invader: to :cloud: Oh, absolutely. While some people may say that colours and flowers shouldn't be gendered, in the context of marketing/advertising, that stuff basically screams, "Our target audience is women, and the rest of you have been forgotten." We definitely don't want that at all. What we're trying to achieve is super important for all genders (and people without a gender) as long as they have a cervix.

:bird: I hope you are also including information about whether the Pap smear providers are open to non cis females showing up for appointments.

I have buckets of trauma around OBGYN appointments. (My first appointment was before I was out but I had been raped by my boyfriend the night before. It was incredibly painful and the provider lectured me about making her job harder because "is it that hard to skip tough sex the night before seeing your doctor? You knew I'd be doing this.")

After that it was years and years to find anyone willing to do a Pap smear. The last one I had was when I married my husband and we didn't want to use condoms and it was required for an IUD.

I had a total hysterectomy in 2018 for medically reasons. While we did two ultrasounds, the 9 months leading up to surgery, seeing my GP and multiple specialists and eventually an oncologist, I was never given a manual exam or Pap smear. Given what cis women go through when uterine cancer is suspected and a hysterectomy is on the table, I assume this is because I am trans.

I would never have insisted on such an ex because of trauma but the medical professionals, unaware of said trauma, never offered one.

:space_invader: to :bird: I'm so sorry that happened to you; I don't know what to say. I hope you're okay.

Since I'm just a programmer, I don't know too much about the specifics of the medical side (but I do know that medical professionals can really shock you with how sociopathic they can be). What I can say is that the charity we're working with run an event where people who have had bad experiences can go and get tested in a safe, welcoming environment. The problem we're trying to fix is that those events are oversubscribed, so the app aims to help people in a similar way, but I, too, have wondered how they'll manage to avoid medical professionals who deal with things in a damaging way. All I can tell you is that I and the rest of the programming team will really push for LGBTQ people to be considered when it comes to offering safe experiences, and I'll pass any concerns that I come across on to the team so that we can ensure that there's a viable solution.
