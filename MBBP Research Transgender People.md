# Discussion with trans people:

## :space_invader: Need opinions from non-cis people with cervixes - making an app that encourages people to go for cervical screening.

(For anyone with a cervix - although opinions from all are welcome.)

Hi! As I mentioned in the title, we're making an app to encourage people to go for cervical screening. The actual charity involved (my team is a separate group of programmers) has a website which specifically mentions women most of the time, but has a couple of mentions of "women and trans men" which, in context, sounds like an afterthought (plus, there's no mention of non-binary people or anyone else).

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to "people with a cervix" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

So some opinions would be great - how does "people with a cervix" sound? Are there any pet hates you have, or things that make you feel like you aren't welcome? Any other thoughts?

Thanks. :)

:shoe: Thanks for doing your due diligence and asking trans people. :) I'm nonbinary and have a cervix. I think if you can use "your cervix" "the cervix" etc. it would be preferable, but "people with a cervix" is also fine.

I'd also recommend staying clear of traditionally feminine colors (pink) or using the words "period" "feminine" or "female." Instead of "breast" use "chest", instead of "feminine products" use "menstrual products", instead of "period" use "menstrual cycle" or "monthly cycle."

Also keep in mind that even people who have cervixes may not menstruate so it's better to use "people with cervixes" than "people who menstruate" unless you're talking about menstruation. And instead of asking if someone is a mother it would be good to say "are you the parent of a child" or "have you ever given birth."

Good luck!

:space_invader: to :shoe: And thanks for replying! :)

Yep, I've already brought up the fact that we really shouldn't use pink, and the team agrees. Also, I know not to use gendered words for things like chest tissue and genitals, but when it comes to the more internal parts, like the cervix and ovaries, is that the same or different?

That's useful information, thank you! I appreciate it.

---

:flower_playing_cards: to :space_invader: I totally agree with what :shoe: said. Along with staying away from pink, it would be great if any pictures of people or avatars in the app are gender diverse. Personally, I'm not bothered by terms like cervix and ovaries, but others may have different thoughts there.

While I think trying to be be gender-neutral is awesome, it's also nice when people specifically identify trans and non-binary people as being part of the category too. Something as simple as, 'If you're a trans man or a non-binary person with a cervix, this app is for you!' can be really affirming and show that you want to proactively create space for those communities in your app. Or if you have a 'Who needs cervical screening?' section, you can include something like, 'If you are a trans man or non-binary person with a cervix, regular screenings are still important!'

Depending on your comfort level with the topic and access to the trans and non-binary communities for feedback, it would be cool to see a section about how to approach getting a screening if you're a non-woman with a cervix, with tips on finding an LGBTQ+ friendly facility and how to approach having your pronouns and name respected, etc. The biggest thing that keeps trans and non-binary from getting these types of medical care is fear of being misgendered or disrespected for being trans/enby, so addressing that concern is really important.

---

:space_invader: to :flower_playing_cards: This is all great advice - thank you!

Right now I'm not too sure about the exact functions of the app (we're on a different project for a couple more weeks, and the reason we picked this project was that the functionality was still pretty flexible), but your suggestions sound awesome and I'll push to include them.

Thank you so much!

:stew: In this context, is there a reason why these services couldn't be advertised as "Open to all", and those without cervixes would naturally filter themselves out?
I say this only because of the general "Hmm..." feeling a lot of folks had when other companies started saying "menstruators" or "people who menstruate". It seems very clinical and objectifying to some, which could be a barrier to services.

In general, I've found myself (as an AFAB transman) more inclined to buy products or access services that visually implied accessibility versus those attempting uncommon forms of inclusive language. Having gender diversity featured visually always catches my eye, moreso than inclusive language which still uses cis female centered visuals.

If you're seeking that clinical angle, maybe "those who many be at risk of cervical **\_, \_\_**, and \_\_\_" and so on.

I hope your project is a success! Gender diverse folks desperately need healthcare access, and this sounds like a great tool to empower them to seek it. One note, be sure users know you don't endorse or represent, etc any doctors on your app (unless you do). We had an issue with an app 'recommending' our organization for services we don't provide, and it resulted in a drawn out legal conflict that really solved nothing. I'm sure you've already thought of that anyways~ Best of luck!!

:space_invader: to :stew: These questions are tricky to answer for me; I'll explain the context a bit better. A charity wants to make an app to help people who have experienced sexual assault to get smear tests. They've found that there's a certain resistance involved (the process can bring back trauma, and sometimes the medical professionals can be insensitive etc.). This is really unfortunate because statistically they're at a greater risk. (You probably know all this, but I feel it's necessary context just in case.) The app aims to guide them through the process and make them feel a bit more comfortable.

We're the programming team, not the medical professionals, but having had a look at their website it seems very necessary to revamp a lot of the phrasing (the front page only refers to women) and some of the design (the logo isn't pink, but the website greets us with a large banner of pink Venus symbols). As the programming team, we won't have control over everything, but we can at least push for more inclusive phrasing and design.

I definitely see what you're saying; we'll aim for wording that's less gendered but that doesn't reduce people to body parts.

And thank you - that's a great point from an alternate perspective.

I really appreciate the response! :)

:cloud: I like that a lot, and I agree with another commenter about not making the presentation all girly. Pink flowery stuff is a visual cue to me (as a trans dude) that that particular thing is not aimed at me and I tend to skip it over.

---

:space_invader: to :cloud: Oh, absolutely. While some people may say that colours and flowers shouldn't be gendered, in the context of marketing/advertising, that stuff basically screams, "Our target audience is women, and the rest of you have been forgotten." We definitely don't want that at all. What we're trying to achieve is super important for all genders (and people without a gender) as long as they have a cervix.

:bird: I hope you are also including information about whether the Pap smear providers are open to non cis females showing up for appointments.

I have buckets of trauma around OBGYN appointments. (My first appointment was before I was out but I had been raped by my boyfriend the night before. It was incredibly painful and the provider lectured me about making her job harder because "is it that hard to skip tough sex the night before seeing your doctor? You knew I'd be doing this.")

After that it was years and years to find anyone willing to do a Pap smear. The last one I had was when I married my husband and we didn't want to use condoms and it was required for an IUD.

I had a total hysterectomy in 2018 for medically reasons. While we did two ultrasounds, the 9 months leading up to surgery, seeing my GP and multiple specialists and eventually an oncologist, I was never given a manual exam or Pap smear. Given what cis women go through when uterine cancer is suspected and a hysterectomy is on the table, I assume this is because I am trans.

I would never have insisted on such an ex because of trauma but the medical professionals, unaware of said trauma, never offered one.

---

:space_invader: to :bird: I'm so sorry that happened to you; I don't know what to say. I hope you're okay.

Since I'm just a programmer, I don't know too much about the specifics of the medical side (but I do know that medical professionals can really shock you with how sociopathic they can be). What I can say is that the charity we're working with run an event where people who have had bad experiences can go and get tested in a safe, welcoming environment. The problem we're trying to fix is that those events are oversubscribed, so the app aims to help people in a similar way, but I, too, have wondered how they'll manage to avoid medical professionals who deal with things in a damaging way. All I can tell you is that I and the rest of the programming team will really push for LGBTQ people to be considered when it comes to offering safe experiences, and I'll pass any concerns that I come across on to the team so that we can ensure that there's a viable solution.

---

:bird: to :space_invader: IMO simply avoiding gendered language in favor of clinical language - anyone needing Pap smears, discussing risks for cervical or breast cancer - should do the trick. Avoiding the pink/flowers/hyperfeminine others have mentioned is good.

I didn't avoid them because I didn't want them. I spent about 10 years scheduling PAPs only to be thrown out of the offices because of my presentation. Idk if you can address that experience at all but when it first happened, a couple of butch lesbian friends found me and took me out for coffee, explaining that their communities experience the same discrimination, from the same offices. The fear, originating in sexual assault, may well be compounded by the medical community itself.

---

:space_invader: to :bird: That's absolutely awful; I'm so sorry. I'm making a note of things like this; as programmers we may not be able to code some sense into these people, but we can discuss some kind of potential solution with the charity... some kind of education program for the staff, maybe? I'm not sure; that's more of their thing, but we can definitely push them.

---

:bird: to :space_invader: Access to sexual health is super complex. I just get frustrated when so much of it is put on the patient. No, not everyone is a good patient, but literally the only half way decent OBGYN care I ever got was from my ancient pediatrician who I trusted after the disaster that was my first OBGYN experience (she was trained in England shortly after WWII, ancient is accurate) and my oncologist.

:tophat: I was just watching a video form the YouTube channel "Mama Doctor Jones." She is an Ob/Gyn and she uses gender-neutral language in her videos. If you want to see a good example of inclusive language, watch one of her videos.

Good Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVGimBeGoM0

:space_invader: to :tophat: Thanks! I'll be watching that right after I take notes of these responses. :D

:gem: As a female software engineer without a cervix you’re the best👍

:space_invader: to :gem: As someone who doesn't know enough about computer science yet, YOU'RE the best!

:sweet_potato: If the actual people doing the screenings aren't properly trained in treating trans patients, then no amount of flowery language will help with that, especially in cases where they have trauma making the whole process emotionally difficult to begin with. Inclusivity is nice and all, but it sounds like you're trying to promote things as all 100% trans friendly just to get people interested while not actually being able to guarantee it? Unfortunately, many doctors claim to be more qualified/respectful than they actually are, so maybe your project could help with that somehow? I'd really just like frank and honest information about what to expect so I could make my own decision about whether I could deal with the procedures and such.

how does "people with a cervix" sound?

Objectifying, to be frank. I don't have an easy alternative, as it's a difficult subject in general, but I hate being called a "person with a vagina/cervix/uterus/etc" like I'm a womb on legs. I also don't like slogans that specifically call out trans men for typically female stuff; for one, I hate being reminded of it, and more importantly, I feel unsafe when it's directed at the general public because it feels like the state of my body is being used as a prop for some political message, or like a big neon sign telling people how these "trans men" are basically just baby carriers.

In general I don't think it's possible to perfectly please everyone, so if you could just keep that in mind it could help? Really the best you can do is just try to avoid these difficulties by avoiding gendered language entirely where possible, just use the proper medical names for body parts while also not referring to entire persons by their appendages. Just don't try to cover up awkwardness by adding more awkwardness.

Some specific, important things to remember, though:

Please don't use language that implies "trans men" as a whole are a subset of "people with XYZ parts". Not all trans men have those parts. It really doesn't help the objectification issue when all trans people are reduced to reproductive organs that many don't even have anymore.

If you must use "person with X part" language, please make sure you're actually specifying body parts in a relevant way. I've seen people say "people with vaginas" while talking about breast health. At that point it becomes obvious it's just an unscientific euphemism for an unscientific understanding of "female".

:space_invader: to :sweet_potato: That's a concern that I had, too. I'm a programmer, not the person behind the app idea, so I don't know too much about how the project will work yet (especially since we haven't started other than a couple of meetings) - I'm just trying to do research in advance so I can actually be properly informed when talking about using more inclusive terminology. I'm not trying to promote the project as totally trans and LGBTQ-friendly; I have no idea what the medical professionals will be like. The only reason I'm asking opinions is that I noticed that the website for the charity that this is for isn't very inclusive, so I need to know the correct language to use when I suggest changes. And I agree that loads of doctors aren't respectful - I had a thought that maybe the app could warn people about that, since we want people to be comfortable, but it'll be even worse if they then have a bad experience right after the false sense of security.

And I see what you're saying. A reason that "people with a cervix" is what we're leaning towards is that this app is specifically about cervical screening, and another reason is the fact that we get that not all women, trans men, non-binary people, and members of any group that may be left out if we list groups that way will have a cervix.
